# 👋 Welcome to Gogorichielab

Gogorichie Lab is a collection of experiments, projects, and resources that reflect my journey through software engineering, DevOps, and cloud technologies.

## 🧪 What's Here

This lab is home to a variety of projects in different stages of completion. Expect everything from quick experiments and proof-of-concepts to longer-running builds. Not everything is polished — and that's kind of the point.

## 🗂️ Structure

Most repos in this org follow a loose pattern:

- **Experiments** — one-off ideas and quick builds to test a concept
- **Projects** — more developed work with a clear goal
- **WIP** — works in progress, may be rough around the edges

---

*Built with curiosity. Maintained with chaos.*
