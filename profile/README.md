# 👋 Welcome to Gogorichielab

A collection of random projects, experiments, and ideas — built to explore, learn, and tinker.

---

## 🧪 What's Here

This lab is home to a variety of projects in different stages of completion. Expect everything from quick experiments and proof-of-concepts to longer-running builds. Not everything is polished — and that's kind of the point.

---

## 🗂️ Structure

Most repos in this org follow a loose pattern:

- **Experiments** — one-off ideas and quick builds to test a concept
- **Projects** — more developed work with a clear goal
- **WIP** — works in progress, may be rough around the edges

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each repository has its own README with setup instructions. Browse around, fork anything you find useful, and feel free to open an issue or PR if you want to contribute or leave feedback.

## 📬 Contact

*Built with curiosity. Maintained with chaos.*
