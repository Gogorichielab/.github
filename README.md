# Gogorichie Lab Org Wide Defaults

This repository provides **organization-wide defaults** for issue/PR templates, contribution guidelines, security reporting, and other community health files. When present here, these files apply to **all repositories** in the org unless a repo provides its own overrides.

> 📌 Place this repository at the org root with the name **.github** (literally `.github`).  
> 📚 GitHub docs: “Creating a default community health file” (search if needed).
